# check-all-the-things

This is a tool to run many tools that can check various things.

## Philosophy

### Check as much as possible

Every tool that is available should be run, check all the things!

### Decisions are up to the humans

Humans are cabable of making decisions but they are bad at finding
the information that might help with making decisions. Provide the
humans with as much information as possible to help them make the
decisions. Some tools will produce output that is not useful so
the output of those commands should be filtered. Output from tools
that produce only machine-readable information should be converted
to human-readable information.

### Leave details to the tools

When a tool can recursively search a tree and automatically decide
what to check, let it. For tools that are less intelligent, pass
single filenames with {file} or multiple filenames with {files}.
If an tool gains new capabilities that are provided by a hacky
check via grep, drop the hacky check via grep. The {njobs} parameter
can be used when a tool knows how to check things in parallel.
