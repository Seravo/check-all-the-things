Description: check all of the things!
 This package will help you check all of the things.
 .
 This package is aimed at checking things that are
 related to packaging and software development.
 .
 To find out what kind of things it checks, take a
 look at the package recommends and data directory.
 .
 WARNING: since it checks so many things the output
 can be very verbose so don't use it if you don't
 have time to go through the output to find problems.
